Platform: Mac OS X
Java version: 1.8.

Note;
-If you load many images at one time, you need to wait a little bit to load the image.

-When resizing the window, you need to do it quickly to reset the layout.

-Do not load other file and images at the same time. 

-Usine java.util.Observer and java.util.Observable to implement the MVC architecture
	ViewModel: Observable
	ViewGrid:Observer
	ViewList: Observer

-Reset button is no the right top. When click the reset button the star will set to all empty star.

I know it is not a beautiful UI design, but i hope you can enjoy my application, Fotag.
Thank you for grading.
